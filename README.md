# reddit-clone

Created a full-stack clone of Reddit using Angular for the front end and the Spring framework for the back end. This web application allows the users to be authenticated, the ability to upvote or downvote, CRUD operations for comments and so much more! This code is ready to run as is. Feel free to make changes!
